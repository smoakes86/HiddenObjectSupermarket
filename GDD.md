## Level Structure

### Early Levels (Onboarding)
- Short aisles
- Large, iconic products
- Bright lighting
- 1–3 items per shopping list
- No time pressure
- Minimal visual clutter

**Goal:** Teach scanning, tapping, and list tracking

---

### Mid-Game Levels
- Longer aisles
- Increased shelf density
- Similar-looking items introduced
- 5–7 items per list
- Subtle visual noise (sale tags, price labels)

**Goal:** Test attention and recognition skills

---

### Late-Game Levels
- Very long aisles
- Dense, visually busy shelves
- Nearly identical items
- Items partially obscured or recessed
- Optional time-based bonuses

**Goal:** Mastery and challenge

---

## Difficulty Scaling

Difficulty increases through **combination**, not raw complexity.

### Visual Density
- More items per shelf
- Reduced spacing
- Overlapping silhouettes

### Similarity
- Same brand, different flavors
- Same packaging shape, different labels
- Color palette overlap

### Shopping List Complexity
- Longer lists
- More specific descriptors
- Grouped objectives (e.g., “Any 2 snacks”)

### Navigation
- Longer aisles
- Later introduction of multiple aisles

---

## Variety & Level Themes

### Section-Based Levels
- Produce aisle
- Cereal aisle
- Frozen foods
- Snacks
- Seasonal / holiday aisle

### Special Challenge Levels
